Fluidigm is an R package that can analyze genotyping data from Fluidigm instruments. It can perform various operations such as:

* Converting the raw data into PLINK format
* Estimating genotyping errors
* Calculating pairwise similarities
* Determining pairwise similarity loci
* Generating a similarity matrix

Fluidigm provides a convenient interface to the powerful capabilities of the PLINK software, which is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset. It also provides detailed output files and plots to help you explore and understand your genotypic data.

# Installation
You can install Fluidigm from CRAN with (soon...):

```
install.packages("Fluidigm")
```
Or you can install the development version from GitHub with:

```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fischuu/Fluidigm")
```

# Further requirements
Please note, that you need to have Plink installed on your system and it needs to be available on the PATH variable.

On the Plink wegpage there are aleady precompiled binaries that can be downloaded, see here

Plink 1.9  :  https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/

Plink 1.07 : https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/download.shtml

# Running example

```{r}
# Load the library
  library("Fluidigm")
  
# Set the working directory
  setwd("~/Project/My_fluidigm_project")

# Define the required files
  file <- "Run.csv"
  map <- "Run.map"
  db <- "Run.ped"
  neg_controls=c("STA-blank", "Chipblank")
  
# Define y and x markers
  y.marker <- "markerY1"
  x.marker <- c("markerX1",
                "markerX2",
                "markerX3",
                "markerX4",
                "markerX5",
                "markerX6",
                "markerX7",
                "markerX8",
                "markerX9")

# Run the analysis
  out <- fluidigmAnalysisWrapper(file=file,
                                 db=db,
                                 map=map,
                                 neg_controls=neg_controls,
                                 y.marker = y.marker,
                                 x.marker = x.marker)
